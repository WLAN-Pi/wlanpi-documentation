The goal was to create a portable, ready-to-use device that could function as a network endpoint for measuring network performance and throughput. Since then, it has been widely embraced in the awesome wireless community and after many contributions, this tiny box has evolved well beyond a network performance testing device. Today, it can also be used as a remote Wi-Fi scanner, packet capture tool, portable Wi-Fi signal generator and much more! These capabilities assist wireless professionals with designing better wireless networks, troubleshooting issues more quickly, and validating wireless network performance. Hardware There are two main component parts to the WLAN Pi: a NEO2 hardware platform and a wireless adapter. Other useful assessories are available, but these are the two must-have components to get yourself up and running with a WLAN Pi. See our Getting Started page to find out how you can get your own WLAN Pi setup. NEO2 At the heart of the WLAN Pi is the NanoPi NEO2, a super tiny quad-core single-board computer (SBC). The NanoPi NEO2 shares some similarities to the more well known Raspberry Pi, however the NanoPi is less than \u00bd its size, consumes less power, and it can push over 900 Mbps over its gigabit ethernet connection. Specs: CPU: Allwinner H5, Quad-core 64-bit high-performance Cortex A53 DDR3 RAM: 1GB Storage: microSD (16 GB card included), can be expanded up to 128GB More info: http://wiki.friendlyarm.com/wiki/index.php/NanoPi_NEO2 Wi-Fi Adapter The Wi-Fi adapter is a Comfast CF-912ac. It uses the Realtek rtl8812au chipset, one of the few 802.11ac chipsets that support monitor mode and packet injection in linux.

Here is a list of the items you are going to need to source to build your own WLAN Pi: A NanoPi NEO2 from the FriendlyArm company (located in China): this is the WLAN Pi hardware platform itself (Note that this comes with a micro-SD card, so you do not need to purchase a separate card unless you want a spare ) A Comfast CF-912 USB wireless adapter: this is the currently recommended adapter to support the various wireless operations that the WLAN Pi supports (you can usually get these fom eBay or Amazon ) An micro-SD to USB adapter module to allow images to be burned on to the WLAN Pi (easily sourced fom Amazon ) A USB to micro-USB cable to power and/or provide connectivity to the WLAN Pi (the flavour of USB cable will depend on your requirements) Optional extra items: A power supply . The Raspberry Pi PSUs work fine with the WLAN Pi and are readily available from Amazon (Note that you can also use your USB to micro USB cable with a phone charger PSU in many cases if you'd prefer not to buy a dedicated PSU) POE Splitter . If you'd like to power your WLAN Pi from a switch POE port, a splitter is just what you need. However, ensure that you buy a splitter that supports Gigabit-Ethernet , as many low-cost POE splitters are only 100mbps Ethernet (which is not great when you are using the WLAN Pi for speedtests or iperf). Lithium battery (in case you want to leave the WLAN Pi powered on for a few hours somewhere) Extra micro-SD card (in case you'd like a spare for different image versions or customizations) Custom Handheld Case : Designed specifically for use with the WLAN Pi, houses the Wi-Fi adapter and USB-C cable, while still exposing the USB port and ethernet port on the bottom, while still allowing access to the MicroSD slot - a great additon to make the WLAN Pi in to a true hand-held tester!

If you have hardware issues, you will need to contact the supplier of your hardware. For all other issues the best ways to contact the team are: via Twitter (hashtag #WLANPi or Twitter account @WLANPi ) the Wireless LAN Pros Slack group (it has a #WLANPi channel - @Sam Clements may be able to get you set up with an account if needed). Another option may be to have a look through GitHub and see if you can find the original author of the module you are having issues with and drop them a note.

Since then, the WLANPi has grown in to a popular addition to the toolset of many WLAN engineers. The project is constantly adding and improving the tools avaiable on the WLANPi platform to provide a richer toolset to our loyal base of users. This site has been created to provide supporting documentation to the project, to make the WLANPi even more accessible to new and exiting users. On this site we will provide information to enable you to buy or build your own WLANPi, detail the packages available on the current WLANPi image and provide update information about the WLANPi project.

This site has been created to provide supporting documentation to the project, to make the WLAN Pi even more accessible to new and existing users. On this site we will provide information to enable you to buy (or build) your own WLAN Pi, detail the tools available on the current WLAN Pi image and provide update information about the WLAN Pi project. Navigating This Site In October 2020, after many months of hard work by the volunteer development team, the version 1 image of the WLAN Pi was superseded by version 2 . Version 2 provides a more robust software architecture that will improve on many of the issues experienced in version 1 (e.g. SD card re-burns for each software update), Additionally, it provides a number of exciting new features. It is anticipated that the version 1 image will still be in circulation for a while, so we have maintained all of the version 1 image documentation here on the documentation site. You can find the version 1 documentation here . However, please note that we will not be maintaining these document going forwards - our development efforts will solely be around the new version 2 image. The bulk of this site is now dedicated to the version 2 WLAN Pi image. The documentation set is under continual development and improvement, so please keep checking back for updates as we build out the new documentation for V2.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-wlan-pi-v2-documentation-project","text":"The WLAN Pi initiative started at the Wireless LAN Professionals Conference in 2016.

The original WLAN Pi platform was based on the NEO2 SBC Kit which was available from the Friendly Elec company in China. However, due to a lack of availability of some components for the board, they ceased production of the NEO2 board and hence the NEO2 kit. The NEO2 kit comprised the NEO2 board, an OLED display board, metal case and an SD card. Theoretically, if you can find a NEO2 board in some dusty corner of the Internet, you could still put together your own kit, as the remaining kit items are still available from Friendly Elec. It's also worth checking our suppliers page to see if they have any kits available. They may occasionally obtain some surplus stock, if and when they can find it, so may have the NEO2 kit in stock in limited numbers from time to time. To answer the question about replacement hardware, the honest answer is that there is no definite date for a replacement hardware platform being available. The team has recently looked at the new NEO3 board from Friendly Elec, but this has been discounted as a replacement at this time due to a number of technical limitations which ruled it out. The team is currently investigating the \"Rock Pi E\" SBC as a possible replacement to the NEO2, though this will require an additional HAT to provide additional features that are required. Realistically, given the requirement for the fabrication of an additional HAT and items such as printed cases, the end of 2020 is probably a realistic time-frame for new hardware being available. As we move closer to finalising hardware details, we will be able to provide a more accurate timescale assessment - stay tuned! Where can I get hold of a WLAN Pi kit? Please check out our suppliers page for the latest information on WLAN Pi hardware availability. Where can I get the latest WLAN Pi image? You can obtain the latest base image from the releases area of the WLAN Pi GitHub repository (look for the assets section that contains the image - the file name will be something like: wlanpi-neo2-v2.0.0.img.gz ): https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/releases/releases Once downloaded, you can burn it on to an SD card as described in the following administration document: Burning a WLAN Pi Image How do I find which image version is currently installed on my WLAN?

What's going on? The WLAN Pi has a very useful feature that allows you to connect your Mac or Window machine to a WAN Pi via a USB connection. This is effectively an Ethernet over USB connection, also known as an OTG connection (On The Go). This requires a USB to micro-USB cable to hook up your laptop/Mac to the micro-USB socket on the WLAN Pi (which is also used to power the WLAN Pi). This is very cool as it both powers up your WLAN Pi and gives you a local network connection to the WLAN Pi so that you can SSH or browse in to it. There are two main issues we have seen with connectivity over the OTG connection: Some cables that look like an OTG cable (i.e. a regular USB plug on one end and a micro-USB on the other) are, in fact, just phone charger cables and only have the power wires through. This means there are no data wires and you can never establish the OTG connection. The WLAN Pi will power up, but the OTG connection will not work. (You can check if you have an OTG connection by looking at the network interfaces on your laptop/Mac - if OTG is working, a new Ethernet port automagically appears.) If you hit this issue, try another cable (or two) The second issue we hear about impacts Windows users.

The image has been rebuilt from the ground up to provide an improved software installation and update process. It's toolset has been revamped, it has many usability improvements and hardware support has been expanded. For details of what's new in version 2.0.0, please visit the official \"whats new\" page. Availability of the NEO2 Device 10th May 2020 It appears that the company who produce the NEO2 device, which is the platform on which the WAN Pi is currently built, may not be able to continue its production due to component availability issues. We understand that they are hoping to have prototypes of a replacement device during May 2020, but it looks like the NEO2 is no more. We will be assessing the new device when it becomes available, as well as looking at possible alternatives for the WLAN Pi project hardware going forwards. There are still quite a few ready-built WLAN Pi's available from the WLAN Pros Store and BadgerFi in the UK. We'll still be developing for the existing platform going forwards, so the existing NEO2 platform still has very significant mileage left going forwards. The current form factor, performance and power consumption make it a very difficult act to follow, so you might like to consider getting your NEO2-based WLAN Pi while stocks last.

The items have been to work well for the purposes of the WLAN Pi toolset. These are the devices that are listed below as the \"recommended\" devices to use for the WLAN Pi. As the WLAN Pi software distribution is based on Linux, it may operate with a number of other components, which you are free to try for your own purposes. However, the development team strongly recommend you use only the components listed below for the widest and most reliable feature support. One area that has many options is WLAN adapter support. The WLAN Pi distribution supports a variety of RealTek and Mediatek adapters. However, the chipsets supported are limited, and the features supported are highly variable between adapters. Again, feel free to experiment with any adapters you may have lying around in your bag of dongles at home, but be mindful of the fact that even if they appear to work OK, their feature set may well be limited.

The NEO2 kit comprises the NEO2 board, an OLED display board, metal case and an SD card. The NEO2 is a super tiny quad-core single-board computer (SBC). The NanoPi NEO2 shares some similarities to the more well known Raspberry Pi, however the NanoPi is less than \u00bd its size, consumes less power, and it can push over 900 Mbps over its gigabit ethernet connection.

It uses a Realtek 8812au chipset and has been the adapter of choice for the WLAN Pi since the early 1.x days of the project. It supports monitor mode and packet injection, so is great for over the air packet capture work. The CF-912 is good for most application but has a slight weakness, as it may report spurious RSSI values in RadioTap headers, causing strange looking RSSI values when inspecting frames with tools such as Wireshark and Wi-Fi Explorer. ( Check out our suppliers page for guidance on where to purchase this item ) Generic MT7612U Adapter This is a \"no-name\" adapter that is available from a few online retailers. Despite its lack of branding, it works well with the WLAN Pi software (and it also fits inside the orange WLAN Pi case, which is a bonus). It uses a Mediatek MT7612U chipset and is very similar in spec to the CF-919AC (2SS, 802.11ac, monitor mode, packet injection). It has a slight advantage over the CF-912 as it reports sensible RSSI values in RadioTap headers. It has a second advantage over the CF-912, as it also reports frame MCS values (which are not reported by Realtek NICs). Mediatek NICs tend to have improved driver capabilities and stability in Linux compared to Realtek devices. Mediatek adapter support was added in the V2 image is likely to be the preferred adapter option for the WLAN Pi going forwards.

It is a 2-stream adapter that provides support for PHYs up to 802.11ac. It uses the Realtek RTL8812AU wireless chipset. It is very versatile when considering the various options it provides for the WLAN Pi, including: acting as an 802.11ac client, supporting monitor mode, packet injection and AP mode. This allows the WLAN Pi to perform a wide variety of actions, such as over the air packet capture and acting as a simple AP. Since the adoption of the NEO2 platform for the WLAN Pi project, obtaining stable drivers for the CF-912AC has been an ongoing challenge. Thanks to the ongoing efforts of Jerry Olla, the project has managed to source and include drivers of reasonably good quality to provide many of the WLAN Pi Wi-Fi related features. The WLAN Pi team recently had a report from one of our kind users (thanks Juan! ) that during an over-the-air capture, the WLAN Pi appeared to be only capturing data frames running as basic rates. After further investigation by the WLAN Pi team, it became apparent that data frames that were sent using 2 spatial streams were not being captured. Single stream 802.11ac data frames were captured OK, 802.11n 1 & 2 spatial stream data frames and all legacy rate data frames were captured with no issues. All management and control frames (which all run at legacy rates anyhow) were also fine. This is suspected to be a driver issue with the Realtek driver, so there is little we can do to fix the 2 stream 11ac capture issue. During testing, it was noted that there may be the occasional 2SS 11ac data frame observed, but this was sporadic and unpredictable. The issue has been reported by other users of the chipset driver, and we have added our own reports of the observed issue. The issue may be fixed at some stage, but as this issue appears to have bene present for quite some time, this is unlikely to be fixed in the short-term. Alternative NIC Since version 2.x of the WLAN Pi image, support for MediaTek USE wireless adapters has been included. The team has received reports that the driver support for the MediaTek adapters is generally better than the RealTek drivers (for the features that we wish to use). Testing by the team over the past few months has indicated that the MediaTek MT7612U drivers seems to perform very well and have no issue with the 2-stream over the air capture. The Mediatek MT7612U adapter option has become a favourite among the developer team. However, sourcing a USB NIC that contains this chipset has not been without its challenges :) Internally, the dev team has settled on what is internally referred to as the \"no-name\" MediaTek adapter. The easiest place to source this adapter is currently the AliExpress store, and is available from many different suppliers - here is once source that I have used: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001510706842.html . (Hopefully, perhaps some of our suppliers may pick up on thie requirement and make these available). If you search for the phrase New arrival Black MT7612U on Aliexepress , you will see that there are many suppliers of this USB dongle to choose from. When ordering, you can expect delivery to typically take a few weeks. NIC Swap-out The good news is that if/when you obtain one of these adapters, if you have the orange-case WLAN Pi kit, it is very easy to swap out the CF-912 NIC inside the case for the no-name MT7612U adapter. Here are a few photos I took when I swapped out my own CF-912 recently.

Development Workflow Our development workflow has evolved over the last year or so based on our experience of trying to develop for the WLAN Pi, together with input from a few members who have had some exposure to development processes. As we develop in a collaborative manner, we use GitHub for sharing code repositories and version control. It is worth spending some time getting up to speed with the basics of git and GitHub before jumping in to development efforts (there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube to help with this.) Having said this, many of us are still very new to git and the whole development process, so don't worry about being the only person who is struggling with understanding how this all fits together! :) In addition to GitHub, a large part of the development effort take place on a developer Slack community. This is where ideas, issues and suggestions are kicked around between contributors The development process has evolved as follows: An individual has a idea for a feature or software package they would like to build They may like to build some initial code and/or run the idea by other developers on the Slack community If the idea looks viable and is useful, a repository (repo) for the project is created by the originator of the idea. This is generally on the main WLAN Pi GitHub site, or may be on the originators own repo - either is fine as long as it is publicly available Development work is usually carried out on a 'dev' branch of the project repo. If others wish to contribute to the code, they may fork the repo and then submit a pull request to the dev branch of the project repo. The project repo owner can then review the code in the pull request before merging it in to the main project repo Once the code has reached a point where it is ready to be released as version to be used by others, it is merged in the master branch of the project repo by the repo owner. At this point, a release number is also assigned to the code within GitHub by assigning a release tag - this allows the code at a particular point in time to be retrieved if/when required. I found the following detailed guide on GitHub which details the process in much more detail and will probably answer most questions you have about the process : https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962 The fork and pull request steps that allows contribution by others may seem a little onerous and long-winded. But, this has been done to limit the number of people who have access to the main project repo for purposes of quality control and co-ordination of additions of software to each project. Conventions There are a few conventions that are well worth observing when developing or contributing code: Before starting work on any new features, code updates or new software modules, make sure that you touch base with the other developers on Slack. Our time as volunteers is very sparse, so we need to ensure we operate as efficiently as possible. There may already work under way to implement a similar feature or another module that has dependencies that need to be accounted for in the new code. Turning up with a new idea of fully functioning code may not be the best route to get an idea included in the next WLAN Pi image release - it may require work in other software modules to accommodate it or may even break existing code. Documentation: coding is the fun part of contributing for all of us. However, if you are the only person who knows how or why something works, then it may delay getting your code included. Each project should have a well written document to explain what the software does, how to install it, any dependencies and how to use it. Source code should be liberally sprinkled with embedded comments to explain how the software operates. If submitting a pull request, ensure that any existing documentation is also updated to include any new of changes to functionality that your code introduces (don't expect project owners to do your documentation) Version & release notes files: each project should have a file called 'version.txt' and a release_notes.txt file included in the root directory of the project. The 'version.txt' file should contain a version number that corresponds to the version release tag assigned in GitHub. Prior to release, alpha and beta designations may be used to indicate the code being reviewed is not yet a release version The 'release_notes.txt' file should contain a brief description of the new features, fixes or changes introduced in this release Special Notes For Development on Windows When developing using a dev environment on a Windows laptop, we have had a number of issues with end-of-line characters being incorrectly set due to the differences between line endings used in Linux & Windows systems. Windows uses a \"CRLF\" at the end of each line, but Linux uses a \"LF\", When uploading files to GitHub that use the Windows \"CRLF\" end-of-line, there can be unusual issues when the files are finally run on the WLAN Pi platform. The best way to avoid this issue is to add the following line to a \".gitattributes\" file in the root of each of your local repos (even cloned/forked repos) to ensure all line endings are \"LF\": * text eol=lf Some files need their execution bits set so that they are executable once downloaded to the WLAN Pi. Windows does not natively support the execution bit, so that it is not included when uploading files to GitHub. Please consult this article to ensure execute bits are set when developing on Windows: https://medium.com/@akash1233/change-file-permissions-when-working-with-git-repos-on-windows-ea22e34d5cee Final Thoughts We're all finding our way in this process of both developing and figuring out the best workflow for our requirements. The process is evolving over time, so please provide your input if there is a better way of doing things. Don't be too worried about diving out and figuring it al out - the main thing is to communicate with other folks so we can all move forwards together is a co-ordinated fashion. It's not easy at times as many of us are newbies, but we're a friendly bunch who are keen to push things forwards. (Newbie note: One thing I found very useful was to work with a more fully featured development environment, as opposed to the text editors I started out with. I do not have extensive experience of different dev environments, but the Visual Studio Code environment has been very useful for me...you might like to try it out too - it's free!)

The software running on the WLAN Pi tends to be from three different sources: Existing Linux open-source packages that we make available on the WLAN Pi Existing packages or Linux features that we configure and combine to provide a useful feature. These are usually glued together with bits of shell script or python to provide the required feature Software written from scratch by our team of volunteer developers. This tends to be software written in Python as so many people are currently keen to learn and hone their skills in this language, but we are not limited to just Python The range of skills among our developers varies widely.

The latest WLAN Pi image is available here (avoid the alpha releases, they are unstable, development builds, Beta are usually pretty good but may have the odd bug) How do I find which image version is currently installed on my WLAN? If you look on the top-level \"home\" page of the front panel display, the version number of the image should be shown on the top left of the display. If you see no version number, it may be that you have quite an old version of image. If you have network connectivity to the WLAN Pi, browse to it (192.168.42.1 if you're on the USB OTG connection) and look at the top of the web page to see the image version. How do I burn a WLAN Pi image? If you'd like to burn a WLAN Pi image on to a kit you've bought or update the image of your existing WLAN Pi, here is a video explaining the process: How do I change the password for the wlanpi user Changing the default password for the wlanpi user is highly recommended to help secure your unit. To change from the default password (which is 'wlanpi'), SSH to the WLANP Pi and use the 'passwd' command as follows: wlanpi@wlanpi:~$ passwd Changing password for wlanpi. (current) UNIX password: wlanpi Enter new UNIX password: <enter new pwd> Retype new UNIX password: <enter new pwd again> passwd: password updated successfully wlanpi@wlanpi:~$ If connecting the WLAN Pi to any network, changing the default password should be a top priority. If the WLAN Pi becomes compromised as default credentials have been left in place, this could have very serious consequences. How do I change the hostname of my WLAN Pi By default, the hostname of your WLAN Pi is : wlanpi If you'd like to change this to a more meaningful hostname, then you will need to SSH to your WLAN Pi and update the /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files, followed by a reboot of the WLAN Pi: Edit the /etc/hostname file using the command: sudo nano /etc/hostname There is a single line that says 'wlanpi'. Change this to your required hostname. Then hit Ctrl-X and \"y\" to save your changes. Alternatively, you may also use the following CLI command to achieve the same result: sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <name> Whichever method is used to update the hostname file, next edit the /etc/hosts file: sudo nano /etc/hosts Change each instance of 'wlanpi' to the new hostname (there are usually two instances). Then hit Ctrl-X and \"y\" to save your changes. Finally, reboot your WLAN Pi: sudo reboot How do I set the timezone on my WLAN Pi? From the CLI of your WLAN Pi: sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata How do I connect my WLAN Pi to my wireless network? Assuming your network uses a PSK, simply edit the following files: /etc/network/interfaces /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf /etc/network/interfaces Edit the file as follows: sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces Edit the following section of the file for wlan0: # Wireless adapter #1 # Armbian ships with network-manager installed by default.

What's going on? The WLAN Pi has a very useful feature that allows you to connect your Mac or Window machine to a WAN Pi via a USB connection. This is effectively an Ethernet over USB connection, also known as an OTG connection (On The Go). This requires a USB to micro-USB cable to hook up your laptop/Mac to the micro-USB socket on the WLAN Pi (which is also used to power the WLAN Pi). This is very cool as it both powers up your WLAN Pi and gives you a local network connection to the WLAN Pi so that you can SSH or browse in to it. There are two main issues we have seen with connectivity over the OTG connection: Some cables that look like an OTG cable (i.e. a regular USB plug on one end and a micro-USB on the other) are, in fact, just phone charger cables and only have the power wires through. This means there are no data wires and you can never establish the OTG connection. The WLAN Pi will power up, but the OTG connection will not work. (You can check if you have an OTG connection by looking at the network interfaces on your laptop/Mac - if OTG is working, a new Ethernet port automagically appears.) If you hit this issue, try another cable (or two) The second issue we hear about impacts Windows users. Please check out this super blog post if you have a Windows laptop and you think your cable is good: Blog Post Link Which wireless adapters are supported on the WLAN Pi ? Up to image version (but not including) v1.9, the only WLAN chipset supported was the Realtek 8812au. The Comfast CF-912AC was the only adapter that had been tested to provide support for all WLAN Pi features. From v1.9 onwards, support for the Realtek 8812au chipset continued, but a driver for the MediaTek mt7610u chipset was also added. Testing was performed with a wide range of adapters using both chipsets. The range of features supported varied quite widely and the CF-912AC is still the only adapter that supports all features. However, other adapters do work to varying degrees and an alternative adapter may meet your needs. The testing results showing the adapters tested and the WLAN Pi features that work with each one are shown in this sheet: link (In a future version of the WLAN Pi image, there will be far more extensive support of features for MediaTek adapters that will be provided by a kernel update within the image.)

Here is a list of the items you are going to need to source to build your own WLAN Pi: A NanoPi NEO2 from the FriendlyArm company (located in China): this is the WLAN Pi hardware platform itself (Note that this comes with a micro-SD card, so you do not need to purchase a separate card unless you want a spare ) A Comfast CF-912 USB wireless adapter: this is the currently recommended adapter to support the various wireless operations that the WLAN Pi supports (you can usually get these fom eBay or Amazon ) An micro-SD to USB adapter module to allow images to be burned on to the WLAN Pi (easily sourced fom Amazon ) A USB to micro-USB cable to power and/or provide connectivity to the WLAN Pi (the flavour of USB cable will depend on your requirements) Optional extra items: A power supply . The Raspberry Pi PSUs work fine with the WLAN Pi and are readily available from Amazon (Note that you can also use your USB to micro USB cable with a phone charger PSU in many cases if you'd prefer not to buy a dedicated PSU) POE Splitter . If you'd like to power your WLAN Pi from a switch POE port, a splitter is just what you need. However, ensure that you buy a splitter that supports Gigabit-Ethernet , as many low-cost POE splitters are only 100mbps Ethernet (which is not great when you are using the WLAN Pi for speedtests or iperf). Lithium battery (in case you want to leave the WLAN Pi powered on for a few hours somewhere) Extra micro-SD card (in case you'd like a spare for different image versions or customizations) Custom Handheld Case : Designed specifically for use with the WLAN Pi, houses the Wi-Fi adapter and USB-C cable, while still exposing the USB port and ethernet port on the bottom, while still allowing access to the MicroSD slot - a great additon to make the WLAN Pi in to a true hand-held tester!

The goal was to create a portable, ready-to-use device that could function as a network endpoint for measuring network performance and throughput. Since then, it has been widely embraced in the awesome wireless community and after many contributions, this tiny box has evolved well beyond a network performance testing device. Today, it can also be used as a remote Wi-Fi scanner, packet capture tool, portable Wi-Fi signal generator and much more! These capabilities assist wireless professionals with designing better wireless networks, troubleshooting issues more quickly, and validating wireless network performance. Hardware There are two main component parts to the WLAN Pi: a NEO2 hardware platform and a wireless adapter. Other useful assessories are available, but these are the two must-have components to get yourself up and running with a WLAN Pi. See our Getting Started page to find out how you can get your own WLAN Pi setup. NEO2 At the heart of the WLAN Pi is the NanoPi NEO2, a super tiny quad-core single-board computer (SBC). The NanoPi NEO2 shares some similarities to the more well known Raspberry Pi, however the NanoPi is less than \u00bd its size, consumes less power, and it can push over 900 Mbps over its gigabit ethernet connection.

The latest WLAN Pi image is available here (avoid the alpha releases, they are unstable, development builds, Beta are usually pretty good but may have the odd bug) How do I find which image version is currently installed on my WLAN? If you look on the top-level \"home\" page of the front panel display, the version number of the image should be shown on the top left of the display. If you see no version number, it may be that you have quite an old version of image. If you have network connectivity to the WLAN Pi, browse to it (192.168.42.1 if you're on the USB OTG connection) and look at the top of the web page to see the image version. How do I burn a WLAN Pi image? If you'd like to burn a WLAN Pi image on to a kit you've bought or update the image of your existing WLAN Pi, here is a video explaining the process: How do I change the password for the wlanpi user Changing the default password for the wlanpi user is highly recommended to help secure your unit. To change from the default password (which is 'wlanpi'), SSH to the WLANP Pi and use the 'passwd' command as follows: wlanpi@wlanpi:~$ passwd Changing password for wlanpi. (current) UNIX password: wlanpi Enter new UNIX password: <enter new pwd> Retype new UNIX password: <enter new pwd again> passwd: password updated successfully wlanpi@wlanpi:~$ If connecting the WLAN Pi to any network, changing the default password should be a top priority. If the WLAN Pi becomes compromised as default credentials have been left in place, this could have very serious consequences. How do I change the hostname of my WLAN Pi By default, the hostname of your WLAN Pi is : wlanpi If you'd like to change this to a more meaningful hostname, then you will need to SSH to your WLAN Pi and update the /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files, followed by a reboot of the WLAN Pi: Edit the /etc/hostname file using the command: sudo nano /etc/hostname There is a single line that says 'wlanpi'. Change this to your required hostname. Then hit Ctrl-X and \"y\" to save your changes. Alternatively, you may also use the following CLI command to achieve the same result: sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <name> Whichever method is used to update the hostname file, next edit the /etc/hosts file: sudo nano /etc/hosts Change each instance of 'wlanpi' to the new hostname (there are usually two instances). Then hit Ctrl-X and \"y\" to save your changes. Finally, reboot your WLAN Pi: sudo reboot How do I set the timezone on my WLAN Pi? From the CLI of your WLAN Pi: sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata How do I connect my WLAN Pi to my wireless network? Assuming your network uses a PSK, simply edit the following files: /etc/network/interfaces /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf /etc/network/interfaces Edit the file as follows: sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces Edit the following section of the file for wlan0: # Wireless adapter #1 # Armbian ships with network-manager installed by default.

Finally, unplug and replace your USB wireless NIC, or reset your WLAN Pi for the new settings to take effect. (For other security methods, look in the following file for configuration examples: /home/wlanpi/wiperf/conf/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf) Which wireless adapters are supported on the WLAN Pi Up to image version (but not including) v1.9, the only WLAN chipset supported was the Realtek 8812au. The Comfast CF-912AC was the only adapter that had been tested to provide support for all WLAN Pi features. From v1.9 onwards, support for the Realtek 8812au chipset continued, but a driver for the MediaTek mt7610u chipset was also added. Testing was performed with a wide range of adapters using both chipsets. The range of features supported varied quite widely and the CF-912AC is still the only adapter that supports all features. However, other adapters do work to varying degrees and an alternative adapter may meet your needs. The testing results showing the adapters tested and the WLAN Pi features that work with each one are shown in this sheet: link (In a future version of the WLAN Pi image, there will be far more extensive support of features for MediaTek adapters that will be provided by a kernel update within the image.) Where can I get help support with my WLAN Pi? Support is on a volunteer/best efforts basis by project volunteers. Try here How do I suggest a new feature for the WLAN Pi?

The software running on the WLAN Pi tends to be from three different sources: Existing Linux open-source packages that we make available on the WLAN Pi Existing packages or Linux features that we configure and combine to provide a useful feature. These are usually glued together with bits of shell script or python to provide the required feature Software written from scratch by our team of our volunteer developers. This tends to be software written in Python as so many people are currently keen to learn and hone their skills in this language, but we are not limited to just Python The range of skills among our developers varies widely. Many are learning, or are very keen to learn, to provide useful features for wireless network engineers through their coding efforts. We have beginners through to people who have bene looking at coding for several years. None of them (to my knowledge) are software developers as their main day job. The environment is very supportive of contributors of all skill levels. Development Workflow Our development workflow has evolved over the last year or so based on our experience of trying to develop for the WLAN Pi, together with input from a few members who have had some exposure to development processes. As we develop in a collaborative manner, we use GitHub for sharing code repositories and version control. It is worth spending some time getting up to speed with the basics of git and GitHub before jumping in to development efforts (there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube to help with this.) Having said this, many of us are still very new to git and the whole development process, so don't worry about being the only person who is struggling with understanding how this all fits together! :) In addition to GitHub, a large part of the development effort take place on a developer Slack community. Tis is where ideas, issues and suggestions are kicked around between contributors The development process has evolved as follows: An individual has a idea for a feature or software package they would like to build They may like to build some initial code and/or run the idea by other developers on the Slack community If the idea looks viable and is useful, a repository (repo) for the project is created by the originator of the idea. This is generally on the main WLAN Pi GitHub site, or may be on the originators own repo - either is fine as long as it is publicly available Development work is usually carried out on a 'dev' branch of the project repo. If others wish to contribute to the code, they may fork the repo and then submit a pull request to the dev branch of the project repo. The project repo owner can then review the code in the pull request before merging it in to the main project repo Once the code has reached a point where it is ready to be released as version to be used by others it is then merged in the master branch of the project repo by the repo owner. At this point, a release number is also assigned to the code with GitHub by assigning a release tag - this allows the code at a particular point in time to be retrieved. The fork and pull request steps that allows contribution by others may seem a little onerous and long-winded. But, this has been done to limit the number of people who have access to the main project repo for purposes of quality control and co-ordination of additions of software to each project. Conventions There are a few conventions that are well worth observing when developing or contributing code: Before starting work on any new features, code updates or new software modules, make sure that you touch base with the other developers on Slack. Our time as volunteers is very sparse, so we need to ensure we operate as efficiently as possible. There may already work under way to implement a similar feature or another module that has dependencies that need to be accounted for in the new code. Turning up with a new idea of fully functioning code may not be the best route to get an idea included in the next WLAN Pi image release - it may require work in other software modules to accommodate it or may even break existing code. Documentation: coding is the fun part of contributing for all of us. However, if you are the only person who knows how or why something works, then it may delay getting your code included. Each project should have a well written document to explain what the software does, how to install it, any dependencies and how to use it. Source code should be liberally sprinkled with embedded comments to explain how the software operates. If submitting a pull request, ensure that any existing documentation is also updated to include any new of changes to functionality that your code introduces (don't expect project owners to do your documentation) Version & release notes files: each project should have a file called 'version.txt' and a release_notes.txt file included in the root directory of the project. The 'version.txt' file should contain a version number that corresponds to the version release tag assigned in GitHub. Prior to release, alpha and beta designations may be used to indicate the code being reviewed is not yet a release version The 'release_notes.txt' file should contain a brief description of the new features, fixes or changes introduced in this release Special Notes For Development on Windows When developing using a dev environment on a Windows laptop, we have had a number of issues with end of line characters being incorrectly set due to the differences between line endings used between Linux & Windows systems. Windows uses a \"CRLF\" at the end of each line, but Linux uses a \"LF\", When uploading files to GitHub that use the Windows \"CRLF\" end of line, there can be unusual issues when the files are finally run on the WLAN Pi platform. The best way to avoid this issue is to add the following line to a \".gitattributes\" file in the root of each of your local repos (even cloned/forked repos), add the following line to ensure all line endings are \"LF\": ``` text eol=lf ``` Some files need their execution bits set so that they are executable once downloaded to the WLAN Pi. Windows does not natively support the execution bit, so that it is not included when uploading files to GitHub. Please consult this article to ensure execute bits are set when developing on Windows Final Thoughts We're all finding our way in this process of both developing and figuring out the best workflow for our requirements. The process is evolving over time, so please provide your input if there is a better way of doing things. Don't be too worried about diving out and figuring it al out - the main thing is to communicate with other folks so we can all move forwards together is a co-ordinated fashion. It's not easy at times as many of us are newbies, but we're a friendly bunch who are keen to push things forwards..","title":"Coding for the WLAN Pi"},{"location":"get_involved_coding/#getting-involved-coding-for-the-wlanpi","text":"If you have a project you'd like to develop for the WLAN Pi, or you'd like to improve some of our existing features, you may like to contribute some of your own code to the WLAN Pi initiative.

Windows uses a \"CRLF\" at the end of each line, but Linux uses a \"LF\", When uploading files to GitHub that use the Windows \"CRLF\" end of line, there can be unusual issues when the files are finally run on the WLAN Pi platform. The best way to avoid this issue is to add the following line to a \".gitattributes\" file in the root of each of your local repos (even cloned/forked repos), add the following line to ensure all line endings are \"LF\": ``` text eol=lf ``` Some files need their execution bits set so that they are executable once downloaded to the WLAN Pi.

The Raspberry Pi PSUs work fine with the WLAN Pi and are readily available from Amazon (Note that you can also use your USB to micro USB cable with a phone charger PSU in many cases if you'd prefer not to buy a dedicated PSU) POE Splitter .

# Getting Started with the WLAN Pi

## Buying a Kit
If you'd like to buy a pre-built kit, check out our [suppliers page][Suppliers]. We'll keep this updated with kit buying options.

One of the easiest options is to buy the kit from the [WLPC store][WLPC_Store]. You get the advantage of having all the components you need in one order, and the kit comes pre-assembled with a software image burned and ready to go. You also have a reputable, single source to contact if there are any issues with your purchase.

( However, if you're a nuts & bolts type of person who like to roll up your sleeves and build stuff yourself, check out our ["build your own kit page"][Build_Own] )

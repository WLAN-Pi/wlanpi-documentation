Title: Administration Tasks For the WLANPi
Authors: Nigel Bowden

# Administration Tasks

Administering your WLAN Pi can be a challenge to those who are not too comfortable with operating on the Linux command line (CLI). Over time we aim to move more towards GUI-based administration, but in the meantime there will undoubtedly be times when you'll need to roll up your sleeves and execute a few CLI commands.

In this section, we'll provide access to a number of tech notes to provide guidance on how to perform the more common administration tasks you'll need for your WLAN Pi.

## Tech Notes

* [Change the hostname of a WLAN Pi][hostname]
* [Change the Timezone of a WLAN Pi][timezone]
* [Burning a WLAN Pi image on to an SD card][burn_image]

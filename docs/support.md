Title: WLANPi support
Authors: Nigel Bowden

# Support
As this project is provided by a team of volunteers, any support around the configuration and operation of your WLANPi is provided on a best-efforts basis. 

If you have hardware issues, you will need to contact the supplier of your hardware. 

For all other issues the best ways to contact the team are: 

 - via Twitter (hashtag #WLANPi or Twitter account [@WLANPi][WLANPi])
 - the Wireless LAN Pros Slack group (it has a #WLANPi channel - [@Sam Clements][Sam_Clements] may be able to get you set up with an account if needed).

Another option may be to have a look through [GitHub][GitHub] and see if you can find the original author of the module you are having issues with and drop them a note.

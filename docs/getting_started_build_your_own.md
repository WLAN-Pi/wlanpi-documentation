# Getting Started with the WLANPi

## Building Your Own Kit
Rolling your own WLANPi takes a little more effort than a pre-built kit, but with a little effort, you can source all of the parts and put one together.

Here is a list of the items you are going to need to source to build your own WLANPi:

- A NanoPi NEO2 from the [FriendlyArm company][Friendlyarm] (located in China): this is the WLANPi hardware platform itself
- A Comfast CF-912 USB wireless adapter: this is the currently recommended adapter to support he various wireless operations that the WLANPi supports
- An micro-SD to USB adapter module to allow images to be burned on to the WLANPi
- A USB to micro-USB cable to power and/or provide connectivity to the WLANPi (the flavour of USB cable will depend on your requirements) 

Optional extra items:

- Lithium battery
- Extra micro-SD card
- Custom Handheld Case: Designed specifically for use with the WLAN Pi, houses the Wi-Fi adapter and USB-C cable, while still exposing the USB port and ethernet port on the bottom, while still allowing access to the MicroSD slot. Creation of Joel Crane [@Potato_Fi][Potato_Fi]

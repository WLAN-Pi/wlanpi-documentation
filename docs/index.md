The WLAN Pi initiative started at the [Wireless LAN Professionals Conference][WLPC_2016] in 2016. Since then, the WLAN Pi has grown in to a popular addition to the toolset of many WLAN engineers. 

The project is constantly evolving, adding and improving the tools available on the WLAN Pi platform. 

This site has been created to provide supporting documentation to the project, to make the WLAN Pi even more accessible to new and existing users.

On this site we will provide information to enable you to buy (or build) your own WLAN Pi, detail the tools available on the current WLAN Pi image and provide update information about the WLAN Pi project.

## Navigating This Site

In October 2020, after many months of hard work by the volunteer development team, the version 1 image of the WLAN Pi was superseded by [version 2][v2_whats_new]. Version 2 provides a more robust software architecture that will improve on many of the issues experienced in version 1 (e.g. SD card re-burns for each software update), Additionally, it provides a number of exciting new features.

It is anticipated that the version 1 image will still be in circulation for a while, so we have maintained all of the [version 1 image documentation][v1_docs] here on the documentation site. You can find the version 1 documentation [here][v1_docs]. However, please note that we will not be maintaining these document going forwards - our development efforts will solely be around the new [version 2][v2_whats_new] image.

The bulk of this site is now dedicated to the version 2 WLAN Pi image. The documentation set is under continual development and improvement, so please keep checking back for updates as we build out the new documentation for V2.

# Getting Involved with the WLANPi Project

The WLANPi project is a community effort and we always welcome volunteers to contribute to our efforts. There are opportunities for coding, testing (no coding skills required) and documentation/web site support.

If you'd like to be involved, please contact [Jerry Olla][jerry_twitter] or [Nigel Bowden][nigel_twitter] on Twitter or track them down via any well known search engine.
